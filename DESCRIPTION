Description: Genomic coordinates of problematic genomic regions that should be
    avoided when working with genomic data. GRanges of exclusion 
    regions (formerly known as blacklisted), centromeres, telomeres, known 
    heterochromatin regions, etc. (UCSC 'gap' table data). Primarily for human 
    and mouse genomes, hg19/hg38 and mm9/mm10 genome assemblies.
