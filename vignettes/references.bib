	abstract = {SUMMARY: Exclusion regions are sections of reference genomes with abnormal pileups of short sequencing reads. Removing reads overlapping them improves biological signal, and these benefits are most pronounced in differential analysis settings. Several labs created exclusion region sets, available primarily through ENCODE and Github. However, the variety of exclusion sets creates uncertainty which sets to use. Furthermore, gap regions (e.g. centromeres, telomeres, short arms) create additional considerations in generating exclusion sets. We generated exclusion sets for the latest human T2T-CHM13 and mouse GRCm39 genomes and systematically assembled and annotated these and other sets in the excluderanges R/Bioconductor data package, also accessible via the BEDbase.org API. The package provides unified access to 82 GenomicRanges objects covering six organisms, multiple genome assemblies, and types of exclusion regions. For human hg38 genome assembly, we recommend hg38.Kundaje.GRCh38_unified_blacklist as the most well-curated and annotated, and sets generated by the Blacklist tool for other organisms.

@unpublished{Klasfeld2022-nn,
	abstract = {AbstractChromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing
              (ChIP-seq) is used widely to identify both factor binding to
              genomic DNA and chromatin modifications. Analysis of ChIP-seq
              data is impacted by regions of the genome which generate
              ultra-high artifactual signals. To remove these signals from
              ChIP-seq data, ENCODE developed blacklists, comprehensive sets of
              regions defined by low mappability and ultra-high signals for
              human, mouse, worm, and flies. Currently, blacklists are not
              available for many model and non-model species. Here we describe
              an alternative approach for removing false-positive peaks we
              called ``greenscreen''. Greenscreen is facile to implement,
              requires few input samples, and uses analysis tools frequently
              employed for ChIP-seq. We show that greenscreen removes artifact
              signal as effectively as blacklists in Arabidopsis and human
              ChIP-seq datasets while covering less of the genome, dramatically
              improving ChIP-seq data quality. Greenscreen filtering reveals
              true factor binding overlap and of occupancy changes in different
              genetic backgrounds or tissues. Because it is effective with as
              few as three inputs, greenscreen is readily adaptable for use in
              any species or genome build. Although developed for ChIP-seq,
              greenscreen also identifies artifact signals from other genomic
              datasets including CUT\&RUN. Finally, we present an improved
              ChIP-seq pipeline which incorporates greenscreen, that detects
              more true peaks than published methods.One Sentence SummaryA

@article{Wimberley:2019ub,
	abstract = {ChIP-Seq blacklists contain genomic regions that frequently produce artifacts and noise in ChIP-Seq experiments. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, ChIP-Seq pipelines often remove data points that map to blacklist regions. Existing blacklists have been compiled in a manual or semiautomated way. In this article we describe PeakPass, an efficient method to generate blacklists, and demonstrate that blacklists can increase ChIP-Seq data quality. PeakPass leverages machine learning and attempts to automate blacklist generation. PeakPass uses a random forest classifier in combination with genomic features such as sequence, annotated repeats, complexity, assembly gaps, and the ratio of multimapping to uniquely mapping reads to identify artifact regions. We have validated PeakPass on a large data set and tested it for the purpose of upgrading a blacklist to a new reference genome version. We trained PeakPass on the ENCODE blacklist for the hg19 human reference genome, and created an updated blacklist for hg38. To assess the performance of this blacklist, we tested 42 ChIP-Seq replicates from 24 experiments using 10 ChIP-Seq quality metrics including relative strand coefficient, standardized standard deviation, and enrichment of reads in promoter regions. Using the blacklist generated by PeakPass resulted in a statistically significant improvement for nine of these metrics.},
